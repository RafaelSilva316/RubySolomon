              I hail from Saratoga Springs where I was part of a National
              Champion Track team. Though I loved being an athlete and love
              being connected to my body, I also suffered from injury at times.
              I know what it's like to not be able to do something you love.

              I went to college at Wheaton College in Massachussetts where I
              graduated in Women's and Gender Studies. Both men and women are
              forced into roles early in life that they struggle with until
              death.

              I was also part of the Outdoors club in Wheaton, where we would
              hike the Northeast's beautiful landscapes. We have lost our deep
              connection to the Earth and must work to return to it.

              After travelling to Europe and Southeast Asia for many years, I
              began my Master's of Social Work program at the Washington
              University in St. Louis. After a fellowship as a Staff Therapist
              at Williams College, I joined the Vassar Univesity Counseling team
              in 2019 where I worked with mainly young adult populations on a
              variety of issues, including the COVID-19 Pandemic.
