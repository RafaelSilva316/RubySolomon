            In today's world we have lost the necessary rhythm of life, the
            balance between work and rest. Constantly striving, we feel
            exhausted and deprived in the midst of great abundance. Millennia
            ago, the tradition of Sabbath created an oasis of sacred time within
            a life of unceasing labor. Now, in a book that can heal our harried
            lives, Wayne Muller shows us how to create a special time of rest,
            delight, and renewal--a refuge for our souls.

            A motivational and inspiring guide to wholehearted living, rather
            than just the average self-help book, with this groundbreaking work
            Brené Brown, Ph.D., bolsters the self-esteem and personal
            development process through her characteristic heartfelt, honest
            storytelling. With original research and plenty of encouragement,
            she explores the psychology of releasing our definitions of an
            “imperfect” life and embracing living authentically. Brown’s “ten
            guideposts” are benchmarks for authenticity that can help anyone
            establish a practice for a life of honest beauty—a perfectly
            imperfect life.

          <p class="book-description">
            One of the world’s most respected voices on erotic intelligence,
            Esther Perel offers a bold, provocative new take on intimacy and
            sex. Mating in Captivity invites us to explore the paradoxical union
            of domesticity and sexual desire, and explains what it takes to
            bring lust home. Drawing on more than twenty years of experience as
            a couples therapist, Perel examines the complexities of sustaining
            desire. Through case studies and lively discussion, Perel
            demonstrates how more exciting, playful, and even poetic sex is
            possible in long-term relationships. Wise, witty, and as revelatory
            as it is straightforward, Mating in Captivity is a sensational book
            that will transform the way you live and love.

              The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity
            </h5>
            <p class="author">Esther Perel</p>
          </div>
          <p class="book-description">
            An affair: it can rob a couple of their relationship, their
            happiness, their very identity. And yet, this extremely common human
            experience is so poorly understood. What are we to make of this
            time-honored taboo--universally forbidden yet universally practiced?
            Why do people cheat--even those in happy marriages? Why does an
            affair hurt so much? When we say infidelity, what exactly do we
            mean? Do our romantic expectations of marriage set us up for
            betrayal? Is there such a thing as an affair-proof marriage? Is it
            possible to love more than one person at once? Can an affair ever
            help a marriage? Perel weaves real-life case stories with incisive
            psychological and cultural analysis in this fast-paced and
            compelling book.

          <p class="book-description">
            Renowned visionary and theorist bell hooks began her exploration of
            the meaning of love in American culture with the critically
            acclaimed All About Love: New Visions. She continued her national
            dialogue with the bestselling Salvation: Black People and Love. Now
            hooks culminates her triumphant trilogy of love with Communion: The
            Female Search for Love.Intimate, revealing, provocative, Communion
            challenges every female to courageously claim the search for love as
            the heroic journey we must all chose to be truly free. In Communion,
            hooks, one of our most revered and acute social critics, answers all
            our questions about the place of love in a woman's life. In her
            trademark commanding and lucid language, hooks explores the ways
            ideas about women and love were changed by feminist movement.

              The Jealousy Workbook: Exercises and Insights for Managing Open

          <p class="book-description">
            From the initial stages of trying to agree who can do what with
            whom, through advanced issues such as coping with logistics and
            seeking compersion, every relationship sooner or later confronts
            jealousy – and some relationships do not survive the confrontation.
            Between these covers you will find forty-two exercises with
            supporting text, developed by a professional relationship counselor
            and refined by hundreds of clients trying to find their own paths
            through jealousy. They range from basic (Exercise Two, Clarify Your
            Relationship Orientation) through challenging (Exercise Thirty-Four,
            Imagine Looking Through Their Eyes and Being In Their Shoes). All
            can be done solo, with a partner, or under the supervision of a
            helping professional, and all can be done before a problem emerges
            or in the throes of a jealousy crisis.
